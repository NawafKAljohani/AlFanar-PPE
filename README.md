## Repository Structure
you can use the `tree` command to copy the file structure and then paste it here
- install
```bash
sudo apt-get install tree 
```
- run
```bash
cd /path/to/your/folder
tree
```
- output
```bash

└── README.md
```

## Configuration
*Specify the prerequisites needed for this project.*
- **CUDA Version:** <insert CUDA version>
- **Operating System:** <insert OS version, e.g., Ubuntu 20.04>
- **Python Version:** <insert Python version, e.g., 3.10>
- **GPU Model:** <write here your gpu model/size, e.g, RTX 4090, VRAM24GB> 

## Setup and Installation

### Using Conda
```sh
conda create -n <env-name> python==<version-number>
conda activate <env-name>
```

### Using Virtual Environment
```sh
python3 -m venv <env-name>
source <env-name>/bin/activate
```

### Install Required Packages
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Description
*Provide detailed processing steps and data format required for training or finetuning the model and mention any specific notes or important considerations and mention any challenges you ve fixed and load sample of your dataset to [release page](https://github.com/WakebDataScience/template/releases/new).*

## Inference Code
*Instructions on how to run inference.*

1. **Navigate to the inference directory.**
    ```sh
    cd inference
    ```
2. **Execute `inference.py` with parameters:**
    ```sh
    python inference.py 
    ```
    - `--parameter1`: *descripe it*
    - `--parameter2`: *descripe it*
    - `--parameter3`: *descripe it*
      
Also, upload the weights to the [release page](https://github.com/WakebDataScience/template/releases/new) and describe each one uploaded with results, epochs, and parameters used. Then, place the weights in the [*inference/weights/*](inference/weights/) directory after downloading them
<you have to create .gitignore so you don't upload the wieghts to the repository>

## Training Code
*Instructions on how to train the model, including arguments and their descriptions.*

1. **Navigate to the training directory.**
    ```sh
    cd training
    ```
2. **Run the training script `train.py` with parameters:**
    ```sh
    python train.py 
    ```
    - `--parameter1`: *descripe it*
    - `--parameter2`: *descripe it*
    - `--parameter3`: *descripe it*


## Scores and Results
*Provide the scores and results of the model and mention the metrics used and provide descriptions.*

## Sources
*Acknowledge the repositories and papers that influenced and were used in the development of this model*
